# Project: Explore US Bikeshare Data

## Description
This project is part of Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Prgram - Introduction to Python course. It is designed to use python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

## Data Files
In this project, the data is provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. The data is available if csv file format for three major cities below: 
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

## Datasets

The data is randomly selected for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
* Gender
* Birth Year

## Sections

The project output provides information regarding computed statistics and details namely:

1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
    * most common month
    * most common day of week
    * most common hour of day

2. Popular stations and trip
    * most common start station
    * most common end station
    * most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3. Trip duration
    * total travel time
    * average travel time

4. User info
    * counts of each user type
    * counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    * earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

5. Sample of data from csv file
